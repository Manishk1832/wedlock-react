              <p className="pb-4">
                Welcome to Wedlock’s Terms and Conditions of Use (these “Terms”).
                This is a contract between you and the Wedlock Global Services (as
                defined further below) and we want you to know yours and our rights
                before you use the Wedlock website or application (“Wedlock” or the
                “App”). Please take a few moments to read these Terms before
                enjoying the App,{" "}
              </p>
              <p className="pb">
                because once you access, view or use the App, you are going to be
                legally bound by these Terms (so probably best to read them first!).
                Please also read our Community Guidelines (which form part of these
                Terms) and our Privacy Policy.
              </p>
              <p className="pb-4">
                Please be aware that if you subscribe to services for a term (the
                “Initial Term”), then the terms of your subscription will be
                automatically renewed for additional periods of the same duration as
                the Initial Term at Wedlock’s then-current fee for such services,
                unless you cancel your subscription in accordance with Section 5
                below.
              </p>
              <p className="pb-4">
                You should also note that Section 13 of these Terms contains
                provisions governing how claims that you and Wedlock Global Services
                have against each other are resolved. In particular, it contains an
                arbitration agreement that will, with limited exceptions, require
                disputes between us to be submitted to binding and final
                arbitration. You have a right to opt out of the arbitration
                agreement pursuant to Section 13 below. If you do not opt out of the
                arbitration agreement in accordance with Section 13, (1) you will
                only be permitted to pursue claims and seek relief against us on an
                individual basis only; and (2) you are waiving your right to seek
                relief in a court of law and to have a jury trial on your claims.

              <p className="pb-4">
                Before you can use the App, you will need to register for an account
                (“Account”). In order to create an Account you must:
              </p>
              <p className="pb-4">
                1. be at least 18 years old or the age of majority to legally enter
                into a contract under the laws of your home country if that happens
                to be greater than 18; and
              </p>
              <p className="pb-4">
                2. be legally permitted to use the App by the laws of your home
                country. Please note that we monitor for underage use and we will
                terminate, suspend or ask you to verify your Account if we have
                reason to believe that you may be underage.
              </p>
              <p className="pb-4">
                You can create an Account via manual registration, or by using your
                Facebook login details. If you create an Account using your Facebook
                login details, you authorise us to access, display and use certain
                information from your Facebook account (e.g. profile pictures,
                relationship status, location and information about Facebook
                friends). For more information about what information we use and how
                we use it, please check out our Privacy Policy.
              </p>
              <p className="pb-4">
                Unfortunately, we cannot allow you to use another person’s Account
                or to share your Account with any other person without permission.
              </p>
              <p className="pb-4">
                You’ll have great fun on Wedlock, but if you feel the need to leave,
                you can delete your Account at any time by going to the ‘Settings’
                page when you are logged in and clicking on the ‘Delete account’
                link. Your Account will be deleted immediately but it may take a
                little while for Your Content (defined below) to be completely
                removed from the App or Site. Your profile information will be
                treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy. If you delete your
                Account and try to create a new account within this time period
                using the same credentials, we will re-activate your Account for
                you.
              </p>

                We use a combination of automated systems, user reports and a team
                of moderators to monitor and review accounts and content to identify
                breaches of these Terms. We reserve the right at our sole discretion
                to terminate or suspend any Account, restrict access to the App, or
                make use of any operational, technological, legal or other means
                available to enforce the Terms (including without limitation
                blocking specific IP addresses). For all users, we may take such
                action, at any time without liability and without the need to give
                you prior notice. Without limiting the foregoing in any way and
                unless otherwise prohibited by mandatory laws in the country in
                which you reside, we expressly reserve the right to terminate or
                suspend your Account without notice (1) for violating these Terms,
                (2) due to your conduct on the website and App, or your conduct with
                other users of the App or Site (including your “offline” conduct),
                if we, in our sole discretion, determine your conduct was
                inappropriate or improper, (3) if we or our affiliates, in our or
                their sole discretion, determine your conduct on other apps operated

                reasons whatsoever that we deem, in our sole discretion, justifies
                termination. If your Account is terminated or suspended, you agree
                you will not receive a refund for any paid service or features you
                have already been charged for. If you believe that we’ve made a

                below), you can appeal using the processes outlined within the App

                  IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS IN RESPONSE TO MEMBER-GENERATED OR PRESS REPORTS OF SUSPECTED MISCONDUCT, THE WEDLOCK GLOBAL SERVICES MAY INVESTIGATE WHETHER A MEMBER HAS A CRIMINAL HISTORY, WHICH MAY, DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDE SEARCHING SEX OFFENDER REGISTRIES OR OTHER PUBLIC RECORDS. IF SUCH INVESTIGATIONS IDENTIFY A PERSON WITH A CRIMINAL CONVICTION, THE WEDLOCK GLOBAL SERVICES MAY USE AVAILABLE INFORMATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PERSON IDENTIFIED BY THE INVESTIGATION IS THE SAME PERSON AS THE MEMBER ABOUT WHOM THE INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED. FOLLOWING ANY SUCH INVESTIGATION, WITH RESPECT TO ANY MEMBER THAT THE WEDLOCK GLOBAL SERVICES REASONABLY BELIEVES TO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A SEX OFFENCE (SUCH AS SEXUAL ASSAULT OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT, AND INCLUDING ANY REGISTERED SEX OFFENDERS), OR A CONVICTION FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING, STALKING, KIDNAPPING, CHILD ABUSE, DOMESTIC ABUSE, MURDER, HATE CRIMES, OR TERRORISM OR VIOLENT EXTREMISM, THE WEDLOCK GLOBAL SERVICES MAY TAKE STEPS TO BLOCK THAT PERSON FROM USING THE SERVICE AND COMMUNICATING WITH OTHER MEMBERS OVER THE PLATFORM. THE WEDLOCK GLOBAL SERVICES RESERVES THE RIGHT TO BLOCK MEMBERS FOR OTHER OFFENCES, OR FOR OTHER VIOLATIONS OF THESE TERMS, OR FOR OTHER REASONS IN THEIR SOLE DISCRETION. CRIMINAL BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS, WHEN CONDUCTED, ARE NOT TYPICALLY UPDATED BY THE WEDLOCK GLOBAL SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, WHILE INVESTIGATIONS FOR CRIMINAL HISTORIES MAY BE CONDUCTED ON SOME MEMBERS, THEY ARE NOT FOOLPROOF AND MOST MEMBERS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE SUBJECT TO ANY FORM OF CHECK FOR CRIMINAL HISTORIES. ANY INVESTIGATIONS FOR CRIMINAL HISTORIES MAY GIVE MEMBERS A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY. THE CHECKS FOR CRIMINAL HISTORIES THAT MAY BE CONDUCTED BY THE WEDLOCK GLOBAL SERVICES ARE NOT A PERFECT SAFETY SOLUTION. CRIMINALS MAY CIRCUMVENT EVEN THE MOST SOPHISTICATED SEARCH TECHNOLOGY. NOT ALL CRIMINAL RECORDS ARE PUBLIC IN ALL STATES AND NOT ALL DATABASES ARE UP TO DATE. ONLY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE CONVICTIONS ARE INCLUDED IN CHECKS, AND CHECKS DO NOT COVER OTHER TYPES OF CONVICTIONS OR ARRESTS OR ANY CONVICTIONS FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

                <p>For information about how the Wedlock Global Services collects, uses, and shares your personal data, please check out our Privacy Policy. By using Wedlock, you acknowledge that we may use such data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                Generally.
                </p>
                <p className="pb-4">Wedlock may offer products and services for purchase on App (“In-App Purchase”). If you choose to make an In-App Purchase, you acknowledge and agree that additional terms, disclosed to you at the point of purchase, may apply, and that such additional terms are incorporated herein by reference.
                </p>
                <p className="pb-4">You may make an In-App Purchase through the following payment methods (“Payment Method”): (a) making a purchase through a third-party platform such as the Apple App Store and Google Play Store (“Third Party Store”), or (b) paying with your credit card, debit card, or PayPal account, which will be processed by a third-party processor. Once you have made an In-App Purchase, you authorise us to charge your chosen Payment Method. If payment is not received by us from your chosen Payment Method, you agree to promptly pay all amounts due upon demand by us.
                </p>
                <p className="pb-4">
                Subscriptions and Auto-Renewal: Wedlock may offer some services as automatically-renewing subscriptions, e.g., a three-month subscription, six-month subscription, or one-year subscription (“Standard or Premium Services”). IF YOU PURCHASE AN AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTION, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL RENEW AT THE END OF THE PERIOD, UNLESS YOU CANCEL, AT WEDLOCK’S THEN-CURRENT PRICE FOR SUCH SUBSCRIPTIONS. To avoid charges for a new subscription period, you must cancel, as described below, before the end of the then-current subscription period. Deleting your account or deleting the application from your device does not cancel your subscription. You will be given notice of changes in the pricing of the Premium Services to which you have subscribed and an opportunity to cancel. If Wedlock changes these prices and you do not cancel your subscription, you agree that you will be charged at Wedlock’s then-current pricing for subscription.
    
                </p>
                <p className="pb-4">
                Cancelling Subscriptions. If you purchased a subscription directly from Wedlock, you may cancel or change your Payment Method via the payment settings option under your profile. If you purchased a subscription through a Third-Party Store, such as the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, you will need to access your account with that Third Party Store and follow instructions to change or cancel your subscription. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of the period you last paid for, but (i) you will not (except as set forth in the subsection entitled “Refunds” below) be eligible for a prorated refund, (ii) your subscription will not be renewed when that period expires and (iii) you will then no longer be able to use the Premium Services or In-App Purchases enabled by your subscription.
    
                </p>
                <p className="pb-4">
                Because our Services may be utilised without a subscription, cancelling your subscription does not remove your profile from our Services. If you wish to fully terminate your account, you must terminate your account as set forth in Section 15.
    
                </p>
                <p className="pb-4">
                The Wedlock Global Services operates a global business, and our pricing varies by a number of factors. We frequently offer promotional rates - which can vary based on region, length of subscription, bundle size and more. We also regularly test new features and payment options. The Wedlock Global Services reserves the right, including without prior notice, to limit the available quantity of or discontinue making available any product, feature, service or other offering; to impose conditions on the honouring of any coupon, discount, offer or other promotion; to bar any user from making any transaction; and to refuse to provide any user with any product, service or other offering or to honour any offer.
                </p>
                <p className="pb-4">
                Free Trials. If you sign up for a free trial and do not cancel, your trial may convert into a paid subscription and your Payment Method will be charged at the then-current price for such subscription. Once your free trial converts to a paid subscription, your paid subscription will continue to automatically renew at the end of each period, and your Payment Method will be charged, until you cancel. To avoid charges for a new subscription period, you must cancel before the end of the then-current subscription period or free trial period as described above. Deleting your account or deleting the application from your device does not cancel your free trial. If you have signed up for a free trial on Wedlock through the Apple Store or Google Play Store previously, you will not be eligible for another free trial and you will then be automatically signed up to a subscription and charged as described in this paragraph.
                </p>
                <p className="pb-4 font-semibold">
                Refunds. Generally, all charges for purchases are non-refundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.
    
                </p>
                <p className="font-semibold text-md">

                </p>
                <p className="pb-4">In addition to cancelling, eligible subscribers must request a refund to receive one. If you subscribed using your Apple ID, refunds are handled by Apple, not Wedlock. To request a refund, go to iTunes, click on your Apple ID, select “Purchase history,” find the transaction and hit “Report Problem”. You can also submit a request at Apple Support.
                </p>
                <p className="pb-4">For all other purchases: please contact customer support with your order number (you can find the order number in the order confirmation email, or if you purchased from the Google Play Store by logging in to Google Wallet). You may also mail or deliver a signed and dated notice which states that you, the buyer, are cancelling this agreement, or words of similar effect. Please also include the email address or mobile number associated with your account along with your order number. This notice shall be emailed to: info@wedlock.au.
                </p>
                <p className="pb-4">
                The payments required under this Section 5 do not include any Goods and Services Tax (GST) that may be due in connection with the subscription-based services provided under these Terms. If Wedlock determines it has a legal obligation to collect a GST from you in connection with these Terms, Wedlock will collect such GST in addition to the payments required under this Section 5. If any subscription-based services, or payments for any subscription-based services, under these Terms are subject to any GST in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable GST to Wedlock, you will be responsible for the payment of such GST and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority. As used herein, “Goods and Services Tax” means any goods and sales or use tax and any other tax measured by goods and sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a GST where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.
    
                </p>
                <h3 className="font-bold text-md">6. VIRTUAL ITEMS </h3>
                <p className="pb-4">At times, you may be able to purchase a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable licence to access special limited-use features from Wedlock, referred to here as “Virtual Items”. You can only purchase Virtual Items through Wedlock or Wedlock’s partners. Virtual Items represent a limited license right governed by this Agreement, and, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, no title or ownership in or to Virtual Items is being transferred or assigned to you. This Agreement, and your purchase of Virtual Items, does not constitute the sale of any rights in Virtual Items.
                </p>
                <p className="pb-4">
                Any Virtual Item balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead shows the extent of your licence to access Virtual Items. Virtual Items do not incur fees for non-use. Your licence in Virtual Items will terminate on the earlier of Wedlock ceasing provision of services or your account closing or terminating. Wedlock may also at times provide Virtual Items as bonuses to, or parts of, paid subscriptions for its services. Your ability to use Virtual Items you have access to in this manner may terminate at the end of each of your subscription periods and your access to Virtual Items may not “roll over” or accumulate through additional subscription periods. Your access to Virtual Items gained through subscriptions may also end if you cancel your subscription.
    Wedlock, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual Items and/or may distribute Virtual Items with or without charge. Wedlock may manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, including taking actions that may impact the perceived value or purchase price, if applicable, of any Virtual Items and Wedlock shall have no liability to you for doing so. You shall not sell, redeem, or otherwise transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity. Virtual Items may only be redeemed through our Services.
    
                </p>
                <p className="pb-4">
                ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH OUR SERVICES ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WEDLOCK IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.
                </p>
                <h3>7. PUSH NOTIFICATIONS; LOCATION-BASED FEATURES</h3>
                <p className="pb-4">We may provide you with emails, text messages, push notifications, alerts and other messages related to the App and/or the Wedlock services, such as enhancements, offers, products, events, and other promotions. After downloading the App, you may be asked to accept or deny push notifications/alerts. If you deny, you will not receive any push notifications/alerts. If you accept, push notifications/alerts will be automatically sent to you. If you no longer wish to receive push notifications/alerts from the App, you may opt out by changing your notification settings on your mobile device. With respect to other types of messaging or communications, such as emails, text messages, etc., you can unsubscribe or opt out by either following the specific instructions included in such communications.

    YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE APP OR Site.

                 </h3>
                 <p className="pb-4">Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. Unless you opt out in the manner described in Section 13(10) below, this Arbitration Agreement requires you and Wedlock Global Services to resolve disputes by binding arbitration instead of in court, and limits the manner in which we may seek relief from each other.
                 </p>
                 <ul className="list-decimal pl-4 space-y-4 pb-4">
                  <li >When Does This Arbitration Agreement Apply? This Arbitration Agreement applies to any disputes or claims of any kind whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal or equitable theory) between you and the Wedlock Global Services arising out of or relating to the Terms, prior versions of the Terms, your use of our App or Site, or any other aspect of your relationship with Wedlock, including claims or disputes arising (but not actually filed in arbitration) before the effective date of these Terms. It requires that, and by entering into these Terms you and Wedlock Global Services agree, that such disputes or claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you or Wedlock may assert individual claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (ii) you or Wedlock may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights.
                  </li>
                  <li>Notice of Dispute and Informal Resolution. Before beginning the arbitration process, you and Wedlock Global Services agree to first notify one another of the dispute in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating an arbitration. Notice to Wedlock Global Services must be sent by letter, and must provide your name, current email address, mailing address, and telephone number, as well as the name, email address, and telephone number associated with your Wedlock account (if different from your current information); and describe the nature of the claim and the specific relief being sought.
                  </li>
                  <p>You and Wedlock agree to meet and confer, via teleconference or videoconference, in a good faith effort to informally resolve any claim or dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement. If either party is represented by counsel, that counsel may participate in the informal dispute resolution conference. During this process, you may be provided with an offer of judgment. A party defending against a claim may serve on an opposing party an offer to allow judgment on specified terms, with the costs then accrued. If the judgment that the offeree finally obtains is not more favourable than the unaccepted offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the offer was made.
                  </p>
                  <p>All offers, promises, conduct, and statements made in the course of the informal dispute resolution process by any party, its agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential and not admissible for any purpose in any subsequent proceeding, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the informal dispute resolution process.
                  </p>
                  <p>The informal dispute resolution conference shall occur within 60 days of receipt of the written notice described above, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon. If, after participating in that conference, the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, the claimant may commence an arbitration in accordance with this Agreement. Completion of this informal dispute resolution is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration. Failure to do so is a breach of this Agreement, and no demand for arbitration shall be valid unless such written notice is provided and good faith discussions have been conducted.
                  </p>
                  <p>Any statute of limitations will be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process described in this section.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                  How Do You Start The Arbitration Process? If you and Wedlock Global Services are unable to resolve the dispute within 60 days, either party may proceed to file a claim for arbitration. To begin the arbitration process, you or Wedlock Global Services must submit notice by certified mail of the claim with an individualised arbitration demand. To be valid, the demand must contain the name of the claiming party (you or Wedlock Global Services), your or Wedlock Global Services mailing address, the email address or phone number associated with your Wedlock account (if applicable), and a detailed description of the dispute and the relief sought. Notice to Wedlock Global Services must be submitted.
    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  What Are The Rules Of Arbitration? The initiating party must pay all filing fees for the arbitration. Your and Wedlock Global Services responsibility to pay other administrative and arbitrator costs will be as set forth in the applicable arbitration provider’s rules, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. If a claim is determined to be frivolous, the claimant is responsible for reimbursing the respondent for its portion of all such administrative, hearing, and/or other fees incurred as a result of the frivolous claim.
                  You may qualify for a waiver of certain arbitration costs under the applicable arbitration provider’s rules or other applicable law
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  What Can The Arbitrator Decide? The arbitrator has the exclusive authority to resolve any and all threshold arbitrability issues, including whether this Arbitration Agreement is applicable, enforceable, or unconscionable. Courts, however, shall have the exclusive authority to determine (i) whether any provision of this Arbitration Agreement should be severed and the consequences of said severance, (ii) enforceability of any or all of the mass arbitration procedures set forth in Section 13(8), (iii) whether you have complied with conditions precedent to arbitration, and (iv) whether an arbitration provider is available to hear the arbitration(s) under Section 13(4). The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available in an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  No Jury Trials. By agreeing to arbitration, YOU AND WEDLOCK ARE EACH AGREEING TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL. Instead, you and Wedlock Global Services are electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as described in Section 13(1) above. An arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   One At A Time. All claims and disputes within the scope of this Arbitration Agreement MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND YOU AND WEDLOCK GLOBAL SERVICES GIVE UP YOUR RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. However, this shall not preclude the use of bellwether arbitrations, global mediation, or batch arbitrations as described in Section 13(8) below, nor preclude the application of the arbitration provider’s fee schedules for mass arbitrations, as applicable. Only relief that would be permitted in an individual lawsuit is available, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of any other customer or user, except as provided in Section 13(8) below, nor shall this preclude application of the arbitration provider’s fee schedules for mass arbitrations, as applicable. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties , except as provided in Section 13(8) below, nor shall this preclude application of the arbitration provider’s fee schedules for mass arbitrations, as applicable.
    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  Mass Filings. If, at any time, 30 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against Wedlock or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, or if Wedlock Global Services asserts 30 or more similar demands for arbitration or counterclaims against similarly-situated parties, within a period of 60 days or otherwise close in proximity (“Mass Filing”), the additional protocols set forth shall apply.
    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  Offer of Judgment. At least 14 days before the date set for the arbitration hearing, any party may serve an offer in writing upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a favorable award, the other party shall not recover any post-offer costs to which they otherwise would be entitled and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer.
    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   Opt-Out. Updates to Wedlock’s Terms do not provide a new opportunity for you to opt out of arbitration if you previously agreed to a prior version of Wedlock’s Terms containing an arbitration provision and did not validly opt out of arbitration.
    
                  </li>
                  <ul className="list-disc ">
                    <li>Previous or existing users. Users who previously agreed to arbitrate may reject this updated Arbitration Agreement by following the opt-out method below, but such users will still be bound by the most recent prior version of the Arbitration Agreement and will otherwise be bound by these Terms. Previous or existing users who do not opt out of this updated Arbitration Agreement will be bound by this Arbitration Agreement and it shall apply to all disputes between such users and Wedlock, including those arising (but not actually filed in arbitration) before the effective date of these Terms. Arbitration demands that have already been actually filed with an arbitration provider before the effective date of this Arbitration Agreement and in compliance with a prior version of this Arbitration Agreement are subject to the prior version’s terms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Method and impact of opting out. Subject to the above, you may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out, within 31 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name, your Wedlock username (if any), the email address and/or phone number you used to set up your Wedlock account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of the Terms and any other agreements between you and Wedlock will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
    
                    </li>
                  </ul>
    
                  <li>
                  Severability. Except as provided in subsection 13(7), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If a court decides that any of the provisions in the Arbitration Agreement above is invalid or unenforceable because it would prevent the exercise of a non-waivable right to pursue public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in court. All other disputes subject to arbitration under the terms of the Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms.
    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  Survival of Agreement. The terms of this Arbitration Agreement will continue, even after your relationship with Wedlock has ended.
